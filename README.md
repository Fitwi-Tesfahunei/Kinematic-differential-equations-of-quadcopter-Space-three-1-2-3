# Kinematic-differential-equations-of-quadcopter-Space-three-1-2-3
These pieces of MATLAB codes solve the kinematic differential equations of a quadcopter and animate the motion.
The motion of the quadcopter is in a Space Three 1-2-3 sequence. 
With these codes, I was able to find the following solutions:
